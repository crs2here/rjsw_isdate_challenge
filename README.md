#Riverside JS Workshop isDate() Code Challenge

This repository provides the coding environment for this challenge: build a cross-app, 
cross-browser JavaScript module that will take a text string argument and reliably 
determine whether the string represents a parse-able date.

##Get started

Fork this repository to your profile or clone it directly to your computer.  It has a 
ready-to-go Gulp build environment.  For those running Gulp, you should work in the source/js folder. 
Those not running Gulp, you can work with the code in the www/js folder.  Please, code your solution 
in the `api.customDateParser()` method, stubbed out in the app.js file.

##Sharing your Solution

When you have a working solution to share, post a link in the Issues section of the 
[RiversideJSW repository](https://github.com/RiversideJSW/rjsw_isdate_challenge).  Good luck, and happy coding!
